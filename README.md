# Pulse Alert

Need to watch your heart rate? This is the app for you! Pulse Alert runs in the background and notifies you if Pebble Health detects a heart rate higher than your set value. You can set the frequency of the measurements on the settings page or go with the default frequency.

The app itself displays your heart rate plus all the measurements of the last 15 minutes on a handy graph. You can set your alert threshold in the app, too, start or stop the background process and snooze the alarm.

Special thanks to [Joel Crane](https://twitter.com/Potato_Fi) for the app icon and the heart asset.

If you have any suggestions for Pulse Alert or a part of the app isn't working for you, you can open a Github issue or contact me directly.
